                        The Thing is a 1982 American science fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter from a
                        screenplay by Bill Lancaster. Based on the 1938 John W. Campbell Jr. novella Who Goes There?, it
                        tells the story of a group of American researchers in Antarctica who encounter the eponymous
                        "Thing", an extraterrestrial life-form that assimilates, then imitates, other organisms. The
                        group is overcome by paranoia and conflict as they learn that they can no longer trust each
                        other and that any of them could be the Thing. The film stars Kurt Russell as the team's
                        helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady, with A. Wilford Brimley, T. K. Carter, David Clennon, Keith
                        David, Richard Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Peter Maloney, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Joel
                        Polis, and Thomas G. Waites in supporting roles.

                        Production began in the mid-1970s as a faithful adaptation of the novella, following 1951's The
                        Thing from Another World. The Thing went through several directors and writers, each with
                        different ideas on how to approach the story. Filming lasted roughly twelve weeks, beginning in
                        August 1981, and took place on refrigerated sets in Los Angeles as well as in Juneau, Alaska,
                        and Stewart, British Columbia. Of the film's $15 million budget, $1.5 million was spent on Rob
                        Bottin's creature effects, a mixture of chemicals, food products, rubber, and mechanical parts
                        turned by his large team into an alien capable of taking on any form.

                        The Thing was released in 1982 to negative reviews that described it as "instant junk" and "a
                        wretched excess". Critics both praised the special effects achievements and criticized their
                        visual repulsiveness, while others found the characterization poorly realized. The film grossed
                        $19.6 million during its theatrical run. Many reasons have been cited for its failure to impress
                        audiences: competition from films such as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which offered an
                        optimistic take on alien visitation; a summer that had been filled with successful science
                        fiction and fantasy films; and an audience living through a recession, diametrically opposed to
                        The Thing's nihilistic and bleak tone.

                        The film found an audience when released on home video and television. In the subsequent years,
                        it has been reappraised as one of the best science fiction and horror films ever made and has
                        gained a cult following. Filmmakers have noted its influence on their work, and it has been
                        referred to in other media such as television and video games. The Thing has spawned a variety
                        of merchandise – including a 1982 novelization, "haunted house" attractions, board games – and
                        sequels in comic books, a video game of the same title, and a 2011 prequel film of the same
                        title.

                    <p>
                        In Antarctica, a Norwegian helicopter pursues a sled dog to an American research station. The
                        Americans witness the passenger accidentally blow up the helicopter and himself. The pilot fires
                        a rifle and shouts at the Americans, but they cannot understand him and he is shot dead in
                        self-defense by station commander Garry. The American helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady, and Dr.
                        Copper leave to investigate the Norwegian base. Among the charred ruins and frozen corpses, they
                        find the burnt corpse of a malformed humanoid, which they transfer to the American station.
                        Their biologist, Blair, autopsies the remains and finds a normal set of human organs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clark kennels the sled dog, and it soon metamorphoses and absorbs several of the station dogs.
                        This disturbance alerts the team, and Childs uses a flamethrower to incinerate the creature.
                        Blair autopsies the Dog-Thing and surmises it is an organism that can perfectly imitate other
                        life forms. Data recovered from the Norwegian base leads the Americans to a large excavation
                        site containing a partially buried alien spacecraft, which Norris estimates has been buried for
                        over a hundred thousand years, and a smaller, human-sized dig site. Blair grows paranoid after
                        running a computer simulation that indicates the creature could assimilate all life on Earth in
                        a matter of years. The group implements controls to reduce the risk of assimilation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The remains of the malformed humanoid assimilate an isolated Bennings, but Windows interrupts
                        the process and MacReady burns the Bennings-Thing. The team also imprisons Blair in a tool shed
                        after he sabotages all the vehicles, kills the remaining sled dogs, and destroys the radio to
                        prevent escape. Copper suggests testing for infection by comparing the crew's blood against
                        uncontaminated blood held in storage, but after learning the blood stores have been destroyed,
                        the men lose faith in Garry's leadership, and MacReady takes command. He, Windows, and Nauls
                        find Fuchs' burnt corpse and surmise he committed suicide to avoid assimilation. Windows returns
                        to base while MacReady and Nauls investigate MacReady's shack. During their return, Nauls
                        abandons MacReady in a snowstorm, believing he has been assimilated after finding his torn
                        clothes in the shack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The team debates whether to allow MacReady inside, but he breaks in and holds the group at bay
                        with dynamite. During the encounter, Norris appears to suffer a heart attack. As Copper attempts
                        to defibrillate Norris, his chest transforms into a large mouth and bites off Copper's arms,
                        killing him. MacReady incinerates the Norris-Thing, but its head detaches and attempts to escape
                        before also being burnt. MacReady hypothesizes that the Norris-Thing demonstrated that every
                        part of the Thing is an individual life-form with its own survival instinct. He proposes testing
                        blood samples from each survivor with a heated piece of wire and has each man restrained, but is
                        forced to kill Clark after he lunges at MacReady with a scalpel. Everyone passes the test except
                        Palmer, whose blood recoils from the heat. Exposed, the Palmer-Thing transforms, breaks free of
                        its bonds, and infects Windows, forcing MacReady to incinerate them both.

                    <p>
                        Childs is left on guard while the others go to test Blair, but they find that he has escaped,
                        and has been using vehicle components to assemble a small flying saucer, which they destroy.
                        Upon their return, Childs is missing, and the power generator is destroyed, leaving the men
                        without heat. MacReady speculates that, with no escape left, the Thing intends to return to
                        hibernation until a rescue team arrives. MacReady, Garry, and Nauls agree that the Thing cannot
                        be allowed to escape and set explosives to destroy the station, but the Blair-Thing kills Garry,
                        and Nauls disappears. The Blair-Thing transforms into an enormous creature and breaks the
                        detonator, but MacReady triggers the explosives with a stick of dynamite, destroying the
                        station.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While MacReady sits by the burning remnants, Childs returns, claiming he got lost in the storm
                        while pursuing Blair. Exhausted and slowly freezing to death, they acknowledge the futility of
                        their distrust and share a bottle of Scotch whisky.

                        The Thing also features Norbert Weisser as one of the Norwegians,[9] and an uncredited dog, Jed, as the Dog-Thing.[10] The only female presence in the film is the voice of MacReady's chess computer, voiced by Carpenter's then-wife, Adrienne Barbeau.[11][12] Producer David Foster, associate producer Larry Franco, and writer Bill Lancaster, along with other members of the crew, make a cameo appearance in a recovered photograph of the Norwegian team.[13] Camera operator Ray Stella stood in for the shots where needles were used to take blood, telling Carpenter that he could do it all day. Franco also played the Norwegian wielding a rifle and hanging out of the helicopter during the opening sequence.[14][9] Stunt coordinator Dick Warlock also made a number of cameos in the film, most notably in an off-screen appearance as the shadow on the wall during the scene where the Dog-Thing enters one of the researcher's living quarters.[15] Clennon was originally intended to be in the scene, but due to his shadow being easily identifiable Carpenter decided to use Warlock instead.[16] Warlock also played Palmer-Thing and stood in for Brimley in a few scenes that involved Blair.[17]
