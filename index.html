                        The Shining is a 1980 psychological horror film[7] produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick and
                        co-written with novelist Diane Johnson. It is based on Stephen King's 1977 novel of the same
                        name and stars Jack Nicholson, Danny Lloyd, Shelley Duvall, and Scatman Crothers. The film
                        presents the descent into insanity of a recovering alcoholic and aspiring novelist (Nicholson)
                        who takes a job as winter caretaker for a haunted resort hotel with his wife (Duvall) and
                        clairvoyant son (Lloyd).

                    <p>
                        Production took place almost exclusively at EMI Elstree Studios, with sets based on real
                        locations. Kubrick often worked with a small crew, which allowed him to do many takes, sometimes
                        to the exhaustion of the actors and staff. The new Steadicam mount was used to shoot several
                        scenes, giving the film an innovative and immersive look and feel.

                        The film was released in the United States on May 23, 1980, and in the United Kingdom on October
                        2 by Warner Bros. There were several versions for theatrical releases, each of which was cut
                        shorter than the preceding cut; about 27 minutes was cut in total. Reactions to the film at the
                        time of its release were mixed; Stephen King criticized the film due to its deviations from the
                        novel. The film received two controversial nominations at the first Razzies in 1981—Worst
                        Director and Worst Actress—the latter of which was later rescinded in 2022 due to Kubrick's
                        alleged[8] treatment of Duvall on set. Critical response to the film has since become favorable.

                        Frequently cited as one of the best horror films of all time, the film was selected for
                        preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being
                        "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" in 2018.[9] A sequel titled Doctor
                        Sleep based on King's 2013 novel of the same name was adapted to film and released in 2019.

                    <p>
                        Jack Torrance takes a winter caretaker position at the remote Overlook Hotel in the Colorado
                        Rocky Mountains, which closes every winter season. After his arrival, manager Stuart Ullman
                        advises Jack that a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, killed his wife, two young daughters and
                        himself in the hotel a decade prior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Boulder, Jack's son, Danny, has a premonition and seizure. Jack's wife, Wendy, tells the
                        doctor about a past incident when Jack accidentally dislocated Danny's shoulder during a drunken
                        rage. Jack has been sober ever since. Before leaving for the seasonal break, the Overlook's head
                        chef, Dick Hallorann, informs Danny of a telepathic ability the two share, which he calls
                        "shining". Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel also has a "shine" due to residue from
                        unpleasant past events and warns him to avoid Room 237.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A month passes and Danny starts having frightening visions, including of the murdered Grady
                        twins. Meanwhile, Jack's mental health deteriorates; he suffers from writer's block, is prone to
                        violent outbursts, and has dreams of killing his family. Danny gets lured to room 237 by unseen
                        forces, and Wendy later finds him with signs of physical trauma. Jack investigates and
                        encounters a female ghost in the room but blames Danny for inflicting the bruises on himself.
                        Jack is enticed back to drinking by the ghostly bartender Lloyd. Ghostly figures, including
                        Delbert Grady, begin appearing in the Gold Room. Grady informs Jack that Danny has
                        telepathically contacted Hallorann for assistance and says that Jack must "correct" his wife and
                        child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wendy finds Jack's manuscript written with nothing but countless repetitions of "All work and no
                        play makes Jack a dull boy". When Jack threatens her life, Wendy knocks him unconscious with a
                        baseball bat and locks him in the kitchen pantry, but she and Danny cannot leave because Jack
                        previously sabotaged the hotel's two-way radio and snowcat. Back in their hotel room, Danny says
                        "redrum" repeatedly and writes the word in lipstick on the bathroom door. Wendy sees the word in
                        the mirror and realizes that it is actually "murder" spelled backward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jack is freed by Grady and goes after Wendy and Danny with an axe. Danny escapes outside through
                        the bathroom window, and Wendy fights Jack off with a knife when he tries to break through the
                        door. Hallorann, having flown back to Colorado from his Florida vacation to respond to Danny's
                        telepathic SOS, reaches the hotel in another snowcat. His arrival distracts Jack, who ambushes
                        and murders him in the lobby, then pursues Danny into the hedge maze. Wendy runs through the
                        hotel looking for Danny, encountering the hotel's ghosts and a vision of cascading blood similar
                        to Danny's premonition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the hedge maze, Danny carefully backtracks to mislead Jack and hides behind a snowdrift. Jack
                        plunges onward without a trail and becomes lost. Danny and Wendy reunite and leave in
                        Hallorann's snowcat, leaving Jack to freeze to death in the maze.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a photograph in the hotel hallway, Jack is pictured standing amidst a crowd of party revelers
                        from July 4, 1921.

                    <p>
                        In the European cut, all of the scenes involving Jackson and Burton were removed but the credits
                        remained unchanged. Dennen is on-screen in all versions of the film, albeit to a limited degree
                        (and with no dialogue) in the European cut.
                    </p>

                        The actresses who played the ghosts of the murdered Grady daughters, Lisa and Louise Burns, are
                        identical twins.[10] The characters in the book and film script are merely sisters, not twins.
                        In the film's dialogue, Ullman says that he thinks that they were "about eight and ten".
                        Nonetheless, they are frequently referred to in discussions about the film as "the Grady twins".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The resemblance in the staging of the Grady girls and the "Twins" photograph by Diane Arbus has
                        been noted by Arbus' biographer, Patricia Bosworth,[11] the Kubrick assistant who cast and
                        coached them, Leon Vitali,[12] and by numerous Kubrick critics.[13][14] Although Kubrick both
                        met Arbus personally and studied photography under her during his time as photographer for Look
                        magazine, Kubrick's widow says he did not deliberately model the Grady girls on Arbus'
                        photograph, in spite of widespread attention to the resemblance.[13]
